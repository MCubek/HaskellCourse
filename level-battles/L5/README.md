# PUH Level 5 Battle

Welcome to your fifth PUH Battle.

Unlike training, you're alone here. But don't fret - if you solved all your
exercises and have a good understanding of topics covered, you should have
no problems.

This battle consists of 5 tasks. **You must successfully solve 3 of them in
order to win the battle.** There are no negative points - i.e. if you solve 5
tasks, but only 2 are incorrect, you still win.

The output will be tested both automatically and manually, which means you must
take care of the output formatting (spaces, punctuation etc.)

**Do not change provided type signatures!** They're here to help you. Use them
wisely.

## Deadlines

Soft deadline: 00:00:59 2.01.2023.
Hard deadline: 00:00:59 9.01.2023.

## How to

You can use cabal or GHCi.

To use cabal, run

```
cabal repl
```

which will run repl. To reload, type `:r`.

If that's not working for you, run

```
ghci
```

and load the Level Battle:

```
:l LevelBattle
```

## Final note

Although you are not allowed to ask for help in solving the exercises, if you
have any trouble with infrastructure, running repl, or anything similar,
**please ask for help on Discord** (but do it in public channels).

# Good luck!
