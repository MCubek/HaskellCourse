# PUH Level 3 Battle

Welcome to your third PUH Battle.

Unlike training, you're alone here. But don't fret - if you solved all your
exercises and have a good understanding of topics covered, you should have
no problems.

This battle consists of 3 tasks. **You must successfully solve all of them
correctly in order to win the battle.** Every task has a single function in the
form of `lb3x`, e.g. for the first task you have to write a function `lb31`.

The output will be tested both automatically and manually, which means you must
take care of the output formatting (spaces, punctuation etc.)

**Do not change provided type signatures!** They're here to help you. Use them
wisely.

This time, you **must not use helper functions.** Use lambda expressions instead
and don't rename the provided functions.

## Deadlines

Because of the midterms, you get one extra week:

The **soft deadline** is Monday, 05.12.2022. at 00:00:59.

The **hard deadline** is Monday, 12.12.2022. at 00:00:59.

If you want two takes at this battle, submit the first one (this one) before the soft deadline.

## How to

You can use cabal or GHCi.

To use cabal, run

```
cabal repl
```

which will run repl. To reload, type `:r`.

If that's not working for you, run

```
ghci
```

and load the Level Battle:

```
:l LevelBattle
```

## Final note

Although you are not allowed to ask for help in solving the exercises, if you
have any trouble with infrastructure, running repl, or anything similar,
**please ask for help on Discord** (but do it in public channels).

# Good luck!
